# getcleandata

This repo was created for a project assignment at the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course, on Coursera.

It contains a code book, "CodeBook.md", in which I explain the variables used in the new dataset created for the project, as well as the transformations which were necessary to create it.

This repo also contains a script, "run_analysis.R", in which I expose the code I used for transforming a given dataset, in accordance with the instructions given at the course.

Basically, our instructions were to use a set of data containing measurements on 30 subjects' performance, collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, while their users did six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, laying and standing). 

The collected data was analyzed and sorted into several different categories, including their 3-axial acceleration and others. Our job was to get the average of each measurement per activity and subject, which led to a dataset with 180 observations (30 subjects performing 6 activities). 

The functions used in this process can be found in the "run_analysis.R" script, and more information on the data is found at "CodeBook.md".

Thanks for assessing my work, and good luck on your Data Science courses!
